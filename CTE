1. CTE for Identifying Top 10 Countries:

WITH top_countries AS (
    SELECT 
        country.country_id,
        country.country,
        COUNT(customer.customer_id) AS customer_count
    FROM 
        country
    JOIN 
        city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
    JOIN 
        address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
    JOIN 
        customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
    GROUP BY 
        country.country_id, country.country
    ORDER BY 
        customer_count DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

2. CTE for Counting Total Customers in Each Country:

WITH top_countries AS (
    -- CTE from step 1
),
customer_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        co.country_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer.customer_id) AS all_customer_count
    FROM 
        top_countries co
    JOIN 
        city ON co.country_id = city.country_id
    JOIN 
        address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
    JOIN 
        customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
    GROUP BY 
        co.country_id
)

Explanation:

In the first CTE, named "top_countries", we retrieve the top 10 countries based on customer counts.
In the second CTE, named "customer_counts", we count the total number of customers in each country identified in the first CTE.
Each CTE encapsulates a specific part of the query, improving readability and organization.
These CTEs can now be used in the main query to achieve the same results as the original queries.

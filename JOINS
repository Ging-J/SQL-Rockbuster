1. CTE to find out how many of the top 5 customers identified in the top 10 countries are based within each country, using Joins to relate between tables

WITH top_customers AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        a.city_id,
        ci.country_id
    FROM 
        customer c
    JOIN 
        address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    JOIN 
        city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id
    JOIN 
        country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id
    JOIN 
        payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    WHERE 
        ci.city_id IN (
            SELECT 
                city.city_id
            FROM 
                city
            JOIN 
                address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
            JOIN 
                customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
            WHERE 
                city.country_id IN (
                    SELECT 
                        country.country_id

                        country
                    JOIN 
                        city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
                    JOIN 
                        address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
                    JOIN 
                        customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
                    GROUP BY

                    ORDER BY 
                        COUNT(customer.customer_id) DESC
                    LIMIT 10
                )
            GROUP BY 
                city.city_id
            ORDER BY 
                COUNT(customer.customer_id) DESC
            LIMIT 10
        )
    GROUP BY 
        c.customer_id, a.city_id, ci.country_id
)
SELECT 
    country.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT top_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM 
    country
LEFT JOIN 
    top_customers ON country.country_id = top_customers.country_id
JOIN 
    city ON top_customers.city_id = city.city_id
JOIN 
    address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
JOIN 
    customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
GROUP BY 
    country.country
ORDER BY 
    all_customer_count DESC;

Explanation:

In approaching this step, I first identified the original query that needed to be rewritten using a Common Table Expression (CTE). 
Then, I extracted the subquery logic and encapsulated it within the CTE named "top_customers". Next, I utilized this CTE in the 
main query to calculate the counts of all customers and top customers for each country, resulting in a more modular and readable 
SQL statement.

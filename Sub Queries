1. Identify top 10 countries 

SELECT country.country_id, country.country, COUNT(customer.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM country
JOIN city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
JOIN address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
JOIN customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
GROUP BY country.country_id, country.country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

Explanation:

We join the country table with the city, address, and customer tables using their respective foreign keys (country_id, city_id, and address_id).
We use the COUNT() function to count the number of customers (customer_id) in each country.
The GROUP BY clause groups the results by country to aggregate customer counts.
The results are sorted in descending order of customer count using the ORDER BY clause.
Finally, we use the LIMIT clause to limit the output to the top 10 countries.

2. Identify the top 10 cities that fall within the top 10 countries

SELECT city.city_id, city.city, COUNT(customer.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM city
JOIN address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
JOIN customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
WHERE city.country_id IN (
    SELECT country.country_id
    FROM country
    JOIN city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
    JOIN address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
    JOIN customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
    GROUP BY country.country_id
    ORDER BY COUNT(customer.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
GROUP BY city.city_id, city.city
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

Explanation:

The subquery retrieves the top 10 countries identified in step 1 based on customer counts.
We join the city table with the address and customer tables using their respective foreign keys (city_id and address_id).
The WHERE clause filters the cities based on the top 10 countries identified in the subquery.
We use the COUNT() function to count the number of customers (customer_id) in each city.
The GROUP BY clause groups the results by city to aggregate customer counts.
The results are sorted in descending order of customer count using the ORDER BY clause.
Finally, we use the LIMIT clause to limit the output to the top 10 cities.

3. Top 5 customers from top 10 cities

SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    co.country,
    ci.city,
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
JOIN 
    city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id
JOIN 
    country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id
JOIN 
    payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE 
    ci.city_id IN (
        SELECT 
            city.city_id
        FROM 
            city
        JOIN 
            address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
        JOIN 
            customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
        WHERE 
            city.country_id IN (
                SELECT 
                    country.country_id
                FROM 
                    country
                JOIN 
                    city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
                JOIN 
                    address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
                JOIN 
                    customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
                GROUP BY 
                    country.country_id
                ORDER BY 
                    COUNT(customer.customer_id) DESC
                LIMIT 10
            )
        GROUP BY 
            city.city_id
        ORDER BY 
            COUNT(customer.customer_id) DESC
        LIMIT 10
    )
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, co.country, ci.city
ORDER BY 
    total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5;


Explanation:

The query starts by joining the customer, address, city, country, and payment tables to gather information about customers, their addresses, payments, and the corresponding cities and countries.
It uses subqueries to first identify the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries based on customer counts, then selects the top 5 customers from these cities who've paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster.
The main query calculates the total amount paid by each customer in the top cities, groups the results by customer, and sorts them in descending order of total amount paid.
Finally, it limits the output to the top 5 customers who've paid the highest total amounts.

4. Average amount paid in top cities within top countries

SELECT AVG(subquery.total_amount)
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.first_name,
        c.last_name,
        co.country,
        ci.city,
        SUM(p.amount) AS total_amount
    FROM 
        customer c
    JOIN 
        address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    JOIN 
        city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id
    JOIN 
        country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id
    JOIN 
        payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    WHERE 
        ci.city_id IN (
            SELECT 
                city.city_id
            FROM 
                city
            JOIN 
                address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
            JOIN 
                customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
            WHERE 
                city.country_id IN (
                    SELECT 
                        country.country_id
                    FROM 
                        country
                    JOIN 
                        city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
                    JOIN 
                        address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
                    JOIN 
                        customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
                    GROUP BY 
                        country.country_id
                    ORDER BY 
                        COUNT(customer.customer_id) DESC
                    LIMIT 10
                )
            GROUP BY 
                city.city_id
            ORDER BY 
                COUNT(customer.customer_id) DESC
            LIMIT 10
        )
    GROUP BY 
        c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, co.country, ci.city
) AS subquery;

Explanation:

The subquery calculates the total amount paid by each customer in the top cities within the top countries.
The outer statement calculates the average of the total amounts paid from the subquery results.
We use the alias "total_amount_paid" for the subquery and "average" for the outer statement to refer to them accurately.
When referring to the subquery in the outer statement, we use its alias "total_amount_paid".
